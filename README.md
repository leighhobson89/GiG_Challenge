# GiG_Challenge
QA Technical Challenge
Leigh Hobson 2018

Task 1:

It is saved as "BDD_Task.docx" in this repository.

Task2:

- Navigate to gigChallenge repository (you already have!)
- Run "protractor conf.js --suite register" for Scenario 1
- Run "protractor conf.js --suite login" for Scenario 2

Requires "protractor-angular-screenshot-reporter" and "protractor" to be installed in the npm/node-modules directory within node.js

Thanks.
Leigh.
